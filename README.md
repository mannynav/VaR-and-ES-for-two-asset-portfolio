This project is one of many from my masters dissertation "Applications using Conditional Monte Carlo for sums" where I used the Conditional Monte Techinque to calculate the VaR and Expected of a variety of different portfolios. In this project the technique was used for a two asset equity portfolio consisting of return from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) stock index and the Russell 2000 (RUT). Archimedean copulas were used to model any non-linear dependence between returns and then this copula along with the appropriate generator and inverse generators were used in the Monte Carlo simulation. To the best of the my knowledge, this example was the first of its kind using the Conditional Monte Carlo technique, which is a variance reduction technique, for the computation of the VaR and Expected shortfall. The good about this method is that it can be shown to at least always reduce the variance in the simulation and do no worse than the traditional Monte Carlo simualtion. More back on the method and the results of this project can be found in my dissertation.
